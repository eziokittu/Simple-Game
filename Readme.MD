<h1><b>Unity Game - "Simple Game"</b></h1>
<br>
<p>This is my first complete Unity Project (developed in 2020 during COVID) where the player needs to control a red cube with controls - WASD. The objective is to reach the green cube. The player has to avoid obstacles in the path that are in red. I had implemented MENU system, PAUSE options, Soundeffects, Music, Animations. The background that changes randomly on every play, was created my me using an Image editing software "Aseprite". I created the soundeffects using "BFXR" sound editor. The music was downloaded from free online resources.</p>
